The following CSS rule unintentionally targets the `::before` pseudo-element of all elements, resulting in unexpected styling: 

```css
::before { 
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This is problematic because it applies a red background to all elements that have a `::before` pseudo-element, even if they are not intended to have this specific style. It also causes problems with other absolute elements that may be placed on top of the red background.
